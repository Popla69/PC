# Build Issues Log

This folder contains any compilation or build issues that arise during development.
These will be addressed at the end of the implementation process.

## Current Issues

### Test Compilation Issues
- Multiple test files have unresolved references to missing classes
- Property-based test files need missing dependencies
- Some mock setups need adjustment for suspend functions

### Status
- Main application code compiles successfully
- Core AI Web Agent implementation is functional
- Issues are isolated to test files and can be resolved later

## Resolution Plan
1. Complete all main implementation tasks first
2. Address test compilation issues systematically
3. Ensure all property-based tests are properly configured
4. Fix any remaining dependency injection issues
